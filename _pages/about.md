I'm a research engineer on [the FAIR team at Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/). My background is in medical signal and image processing. I've worked on projects involving optical, X-ray CT, and MR imaging systems. In my free time I like to ride my bike around New York City, play video games, and read books about history.

## Past Lives

I got my bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering from [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) in 2011. After that, I spent 2011-2016 at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu) working on my PhD on MRI reconstruction methods under the supervision of Professors [Jeff Fessler](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/) and [Doug Noll](https://nollresearch.engin.umich.edu). In 2016 I began a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the [NYU School of Medicine](https://med.nyu.edu) working on reconstruction methods for a novel interrupted-beam X-ray CT system with Professor [Ricardo Otazo](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/ricardo-otazo). Beginning in 2018, I was promoted to Research Scientist and started to work on deep learning for MRI with Professor [Florian Knoll](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/florian-knoll). In February of 2020 I joined FAIR as a Research Engineer, where I helped lead initiatives on [fastMRI](https://fastmri.org) and [COVID Deterioration Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04909). I'm currently working on neural compression, for which I maintain an [open-source software repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/NeuralCompression).

## Note to Recruiters

I receive many messages about various career opportunities, but I am generally not looking for new jobs and don't have time to politely decline each message. If you message me on social media (e.g., LinkedIn) and I haven't met you in real life, there is a decent chance I won't reply. My sincerest apologies.
